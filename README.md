Shut App is a ReactJS app for speechless communication â€” use it anytime you want to talk to someone at a distance, don't know how to pronounce something in local language (say, an address in a cab) or just don't feel like talking. It's live on [shutapp.today](http://shutapp.today). It also has a [React Native counterpart](https://github.com/andreevanatasha/shut-app-native).
